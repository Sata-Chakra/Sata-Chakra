👋 Hi, I'm Satadal Chakravarty
🚀 Lead AI Engineer | 🧠 AI & Geospatial Enthusiast | 🌍 Building Intelligence from Earth & Data

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Satadal, a passionate engineer with over 7 years of hands-on experience transforming real-world problems into intelligent, scalable solutions. My work lives at the intersection of AI, geospatial intelligence, and human-centered design — where  data meets machine learning, and insights drive action.

🛰️ What I Do:

🔐 Data Anonymization – Privacy-first solutions with role-based access controls.

🌿 Satellite Monitoring – Tracking growth and change using Sentinel, MODIS, and UAV datasets.

🔮 Predictive Forecasting – Building ML models that don’t just explain the past, but foresee the future....and much more

🛠️ Languages & Tools I Use Often:
Python | Azure | GeoPandas | Google Earth Engine | AWS SageMaker | Azure Databricks | Scikit-Learn | MMDetection/MMPose | Flask | OpenCV

🌍 Currently focused on building systems that make airports smarter, cities safer, and data more meaningful. Whether it's using facial recognition for non-invasive goat tracking or decoding flight delays through real-time emissions data — I love working on things that push boundaries.
